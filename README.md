# Variational Quantum Classifier using low-rank approximation for state preparation
Trying to create a variational quantum classifier using low-rank approximation for state preparation from https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03132. The same code was used to running with ZZ Pauli Feature Map and a success rate of 100% was obtained, but for amplitude embedding it is getting bad results.
